# RFC 003: Content Strategy Evolution for Technology Leadership Platform

**Status:** Revised for Static Hosting  
**Type:** Content Strategy  
**Created:** 2025-01-13  
**Updated:** 2025-01-13  
**Author:** Technology Leadership Team  

## Executive Summary

This RFC proposes a comprehensive evolution of our content strategy to transform the Technology Leadership Platform from an implementation-focused knowledge base into a more accessible, user-centric learning platform optimized for static site hosting on GitHub Pages. The analysis reveals strong foundational frameworks but identifies critical opportunities to improve content organization, reduce implementation complexity, and enhance user experience within the constraints of static site hosting.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Two robust frameworks (Engineering Practices, Operating Model) with extensive wiki content
- **Quality Writing**: High-quality, detailed articles (3,000-6,000 words) with strong industry research integration
- **Technical Excellence**: Well-structured content with proper metadata, cross-references, and visual elements
- **Research Foundation**: Strong integration of proven methodologies (DDD, Wardley Mapping, Team Topologies, DevEx research)

### Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Content Purpose Confusion
**Problem**: Unclear distinction between blog and wiki content roles
- Blog posts often read like implementation guides rather than insights
- Wiki content includes time-bound implementation details
- Overlapping content creates user confusion about where to find information

#### 2. Implementation Complexity Overload
**Problem**: Heavy focus on prescriptive implementation timelines
- Detailed 3-6 month roadmaps in most content
- One-size-fits-all approaches don't account for organizational diversity
- Overwhelming detail may discourage adoption rather than enable it

#### 3. Content Discovery Challenges
**Problem**: Despite good structure, finding relevant content for specific situations is difficult
- Multiple entry points without clear progressive learning paths
- Information overload from comprehensive individual pieces
- Limited content for users new to technology leadership

#### 4. Missing Critical Content Areas
**Problem**: Significant gaps in user-centric content
- Limited beginner-friendly orientation content
- Missing assessment and measurement tools
- No industry-specific adaptation guidance
- Insufficient executive/business case content

## Proposed Content Strategy Evolution

### 1. Content Type Clarification

#### Blog Content Purpose
Transform blog from implementation-heavy to insight-focused:
- **Industry Analysis**: Trend analysis, market insights, research summaries
- **Case Studies**: Real-world success stories and lessons learned
- **Thought Leadership**: Commentary on industry developments and best practices
- **Tool Evaluations**: Comparative analysis of tools and approaches
- **Community Insights**: User-contributed experiences and adaptations

#### Wiki Content Purpose
Refocus wiki as evergreen reference and guidance (designed for static implementation):
- **Framework Definitions**: Core concepts and principles with embedded interactive elements
- **Pattern Libraries**: Reusable templates and examples downloadable as static files
- **How-To Guides**: Step-by-step guidance with embedded calculators and tools

- **Predictable Costs**: No variable server or database costs
- **Easy Deployment**: Changes go live automatically via git push
- **Open Source Compatible**: Easy for community to contribute improvements

## Conclusion

This revised RFC proposes a fundamental evolution of our content strategy that aligns with both user needs and the technical constraints of static site hosting. The combination of reducing implementation prescription while adding client-side interactivity creates a more valuable and accessible platform.

The key insight is that static doesn't mean passive. By leveraging client-side JavaScript, localStorage, and build-time generation, we can create rich interactive experiences that rival server-based applications while maintaining the simplicity, privacy, and performance benefits of static hosting.

The static-first approach actually enhances the user-enabling philosophy: users get powerful tools and assessments without compromising their privacy or requiring complex setup. This aligns perfectly with the goal of enabling informed decision-making rather than dictating specific approaches.

Success will be measured by user engagement with interactive features, completion of assessments, and ultimately, more successful framework implementations guided by personalized, context-aware recommendations generated entirely client-side.
