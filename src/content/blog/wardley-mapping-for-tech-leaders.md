# Wardley Mapping for Technology Leaders: Strategic Planning with Visual Clarity

Strategy in technology leadership often feels like navigating in the dark. We make decisions about architecture, team structure, and technology investments based on incomplete information and competing priorities. Traditional strategic planning tools—SWOT analyses, business model canvases, roadmaps—provide frameworks but often miss the dynamic nature of technology evolution and competitive landscapes.

Wardley Mapping, developed by Simon Wardley, offers a powerful visual approach to strategic thinking that's particularly valuable for technology leaders. By mapping the evolution of components in your value chain, you can make more informed decisions about where to invest, what to build vs. buy, and how to structure your organization for success. This post explores how Wardley Mapping integrates with our [operating model framework](../wiki/operating-model) to provide strategic clarity for technology organizations.

## What Are Wardley Maps?

### The Basics of Wardley Mapping

A Wardley Map is a visual representation that shows:

**Value Chain (Y-Axis)**: Components arranged from user-visible value at the top to foundational components at the bottom
**Evolution (X-Axis)**: The maturity of each component, from genesis (novel/custom) to commodity (ubiquitous/utility)
**Dependencies**: How components depend on each other to deliver value

**Example Technology Stack Map**:
```
User Need (Customer Experience)
    ↓
Web Application (Product)
    ↓
API Gateway (Custom/Product)
    ↓
Microservices (Custom)
    ↓
Container Platform (Product)
    ↓
Cloud Infrastructure (Commodity)
```

### The Evolution Axis

Components evolve through predictable stages:

**Genesis (I)**: Brand new, experimental, high uncertainty
- Example: AI/ML capabilities in 2018

**Custom Built (II)**: Understood but still requires custom development
- Example: Recommendation engines for e-commerce

**Product/Rental (III)**: Available as products but requires selection and integration
- Example: Container orchestration platforms

**Commodity/Utility (IV)**: Standardized, ubiquitous, often utility-like
- Example: Cloud compute and storage

Understanding where each component sits on this evolution helps inform strategic decisions about build vs. buy, investment priorities, and competitive positioning.

## Strategic Applications for Technology Leaders

### Technology Investment Decisions

Wardley Maps help answer critical investment questions:

**Where Should We Build vs. Buy?**
- Components in Genesis/Custom stages: Consider building for competitive advantage
- Components in Product/Commodity stages: Usually buy to focus resources on differentiation

**Example: Authentication Strategy**
```
User Authentication (Visible Value)
    ↓
Identity Management (Custom → Product)
    ↓
Authentication Protocols (Commodity)
    ↓
Cryptographic Functions (Commodity)
```

**Strategic Decision**: Since identity management has moved from custom to product stage, invest in integration with established providers (Auth0, Okta) rather than building custom solutions.

### Organizational Design Insights

Our [organizational design approaches](../blog/organizational-design-at-scale) benefit from Wardley Mapping insights:

**Team Structure Alignment**:
- Genesis/Custom components: Dedicated innovation teams with high autonomy
- Product components: Cross-functional teams for integration and customization
- Commodity components: Shared platform teams providing utility services

**Example: Data Platform Evolution**
```
Business Intelligence (User Value)
    ↓
Data Analytics (Custom → Product)
    ↓
Data Pipeline (Custom)
    ↓
Data Storage (Product → Commodity)
    ↓
Cloud Infrastructure (Commodity)
```

**Organizational Implications**:
- **Data Analytics Team**: Focus on business-specific insights and custom analytics
- **Platform Team**: Provide shared data pipeline and storage utilities
- **Cloud Operations**: Treat as commodity utility service

### Architecture Evolution Planning

Wardley Maps reveal how system architecture should evolve over time:

**Microservices Evolution Example**:
```
Customer Experience (User Visible)
    ↓
Application Services (Custom)
    ↓
Service Mesh (Product → Commodity)
    ↓
Container Orchestration (Commodity)
    ↓
Cloud Infrastructure (Commodity)
```

**Strategic Implications**:
- Invest heavily in application services (competitive differentiator)
- Adopt standard service mesh products rather than building custom
- Treat container orchestration as utility (use managed Kubernetes)

## Integrating Wardley Maps with Our Frameworks

### Connection to Engineering Practices

Our [engineering practices framework](../wiki/engineering-practices) aligns with Wardley Map evolution stages:

**Genesis/Custom Components** → **[Normalization Stage](../wiki/engineering-practices/normalization)**:
- Focus on establishing basic practices and version control
- High variability and experimentation

**Product Components** → **[Standardization Stage](../wiki/engineering-practices/standardization)**:
- Implement [Golden Paths](../wiki/engineering-practices/standardization/golden-path)
- Standardize on proven products and patterns

**Commodity Components** → **[Self-Service Stage](../wiki/engineering-practices/self-service)**:
- Build [self-service platforms](../wiki/engineering-practices/self-service/self-service-platform)
- Treat as utility services with high automation

### Operating Model Alignment

Wardley Maps inform our [operating model decisions](../wiki/operating-model):

**[Mission and Objectives](../wiki/operating-model/core-elements/mission-product-canvas)**:
- Map current capabilities against strategic objectives
- Identify gaps between current state and desired outcomes

**[Team Topologies](../wiki/operating-model/advanced/team-topologies)**:
- Stream-aligned teams own Genesis/Custom components
- Platform teams provide Product/Commodity components as services
- Complicated subsystem teams handle complex product integrations

**[Decision-Making Authority](../wiki/operating-model/operations/decision-making)**:
- Distribute authority based on component evolution stage
- Higher autonomy for Genesis/Custom components
- Standardized decisions for Commodity components

## Creating Your First Technology Wardley Map

### Step 1: Identify Your Value Chain

Start with a user need and work backwards through dependencies:

**Example: E-commerce Platform**
1. Customer Purchase (User Need)
2. Shopping Cart (Visible Component)
3. Product Catalog (Visible Component)
4. Payment Processing (Essential Component)
5. Inventory Management (Essential Component)
6. Database (Supporting Component)
7. Cloud Infrastructure (Foundation Component)

### Step 2: Assess Evolution Stage

For each component, determine its current evolution stage:

**Questions to Ask**:
- How standard is this capability across the industry?
- Are there multiple competing products available?
- How much custom development is required?
- How critical is this for competitive differentiation?

**Example Assessment**:
```yaml
Payment Processing:
  Current Stage: Product (III)
  Rationale: Multiple providers (Stripe, PayPal), well-understood integration
  
Product Recommendation:
  Current Stage: Custom (II)
  Rationale: Algorithm provides competitive advantage, requires domain expertise
  
Cloud Infrastructure:
  Current Stage: Commodity (IV)
  Rationale: AWS/Azure/GCP are utility services, minimal differentiation
```

### Step 3: Map Dependencies and Identify Patterns

Look for strategic patterns:

**Potential Issues**:
- **Over-Engineering**: Building custom solutions for commodity components
- **Under-Investment**: Not investing enough in Genesis/Custom differentiators
- **Evolution Mismatch**: Team structures that don't match component evolution

**Strategic Opportunities**:
- **Build Competitive Moats**: Invest heavily in Genesis/Custom components
- **Optimize Costs**: Use commodity services for non-differentiating capabilities
- **Time Evolution**: Plan for components moving between evolution stages

## Strategic Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Successful Patterns

**Platform Strategy**:
- Build platforms around commodity/product components
- Enable teams to focus on custom/genesis innovation
- Reduce duplication of effort across teams

**Example: Internal Developer Platform**
```
Developer Experience (User Value)
    ↓
Application Deployment (Custom)
    ↓
CI/CD Pipeline (Product)
    ↓
Container Platform (Product → Commodity)
    ↓
Cloud Infrastructure (Commodity)
```

**Strategic Approach**: Create self-service platform that abstracts away commodity layers while enabling custom application innovation.

### Common Anti-Patterns

**The "Build Everything" Trap**:
Building custom solutions for components that have evolved to product/commodity stage.

**Example Problem**:
```
Custom Message Queue (Custom) ← Should use SQS/RabbitMQ
    ↓
Custom Container Orchestration (Custom) ← Should use Kubernetes
    ↓
Custom Cloud Abstraction (Custom) ← Should use standard cloud services
```

**The "Buy Everything" Trap**:
Using products for components where custom development would provide competitive advantage.

**Example Problem**:
```
Generic CRM (Product) ← Should build domain-specific customer management
    ↓
Standard Analytics (Product) ← Should build custom business intelligence
    ↓
Generic ML Platform (Product) ← Should build specialized algorithms
```

## Wardley Mapping for Architecture Decisions

### Cloud Migration Strategy

Wardley Maps help prioritize cloud migration efforts:

**Migration Priority Framework**:
1. **Commodity Components First**: Move infrastructure and standard services
2. **Product Components Second**: Migrate or replace with cloud-native products
3. **Custom Components Last**: Refactor applications for cloud optimization

**Example Migration Map**:
```
Business Applications (Custom) ← Migrate Last, Requires Refactoring
    ↓
Application Framework (Product) ← Migrate Second, Cloud-Native Options
    ↓
Database (Product → Commodity) ← Migrate Early, Managed Services Available
    ↓
Compute/Storage (Commodity) ← Migrate First, Direct Lift-and-Shift
```

### Technology Stack Evolution

Plan technology stack evolution based on component maturity:

**Container Platform Evolution**:
```yaml
2020 Map:
  Container Orchestration: Custom (Docker Swarm)
  Service Discovery: Custom
  Load Balancing: Custom

2023 Map:
  Container Orchestration: Product (Kubernetes)
  Service Discovery: Product (Istio)
  Load Balancing: Product (Ingress Controllers)

2025 Target:
  Container Platform: Commodity (Managed Kubernetes)
  Service Mesh: Commodity (Standard Istio)
  Application Services: Custom (Business Logic)
```

### Build vs. Buy Decisions

Use evolution stage to guide build vs. buy decisions:

**Decision Framework**:
```yaml
Genesis Stage: Build if core competency, buy if not
Custom Stage: Build for differentiation, buy for table stakes
Product Stage: Buy unless unique requirements
Commodity Stage: Always buy/use utility services
```

**Example: Monitoring Strategy**
```
Application Performance Monitoring:
  Stage: Product
  Decision: Buy (DataDog, New Relic)
  Rationale: Commodity capability, focus resources elsewhere

Business Metrics Dashboard:
  Stage: Custom
  Decision: Build
  Rationale: Unique business requirements, competitive insight
```

## Wardley Maps and Team Strategy

### Autonomous Team Boundaries

Our [autonomous teams framework](../wiki/engineering-practices/expansion/autonomous-teams) benefits from Wardley Map insights:

**Team Boundary Principles**:
- Teams own complete value streams when possible
- Minimize dependencies between teams at different evolution stages
- Create platform teams for commodity/product components

**Example: E-commerce Team Structure**
```yaml
Customer Experience Team (Stream-Aligned):
  Owns: Shopping experience, checkout flow
  Components: Mostly Custom/Product stage
  
Payment Platform Team (Platform):
  Owns: Payment processing, fraud detection
  Components: Product/Commodity stage
  
Infrastructure Team (Platform):
  Owns: Cloud services, monitoring, security
  Components: Commodity stage
```

### Skills and Hiring Strategy

  Data Processing: Commodity
  Strategy: Focus on data quality and business logic

Scenario B: AI Remains Complex
  ML Platforms: Custom → Product (2027)
  Data Science: Custom
  Strategy: Build internal ML expertise
```

### Competitive Analysis

Map competitor capabilities to understand strategic positioning:

**Competitive Landscape Analysis**:
- Where do competitors have commodity vs. custom components?
- What are their likely strategic moves based on evolution?
- Where can you create competitive advantage?

**Example: Fintech Competitive Map**
```yaml
Your Company:
  Payment Processing: Product (Stripe)
  Risk Engine: Custom (Competitive Advantage)
  
Competitor A:
  Payment Processing: Custom (Legacy Investment)
  Risk Engine: Product (Third-party)
  
Strategic Insight: 
  Focus on risk engine innovation while they're distracted by payment infrastructure
```
