# Tech Leadership in Plain English: Demystifying Engineering Management Concepts

The technology industry loves its jargon. We have acronyms for everything, buzzwords that change every quarter, and concepts that sound intimidating but are often quite simple underneath. Inspired by the excellent [AWS in Plain English](https://expeditedsecurity.com/aws-in-plain-english/) guide that translates complex AWS services into understandable terms, this post breaks down common engineering leadership concepts into language that everyone—from new managers to seasoned executives—can understand.

## Why "Plain English" Matters in Tech Leadership

### The Jargon Problem

Technology leadership suffers from the same problem as AWS services: we use complex names and acronyms that obscure what we're actually trying to accomplish. Consider these common scenarios:

**In Meetings**: "We need to improve our DORA metrics through DevSecOps integration in our CI/CD pipeline to enhance our developer experience."

**Translation**: "We want to deploy software faster and more reliably by automating security checks and making developers' jobs easier."

**In Strategy Documents**: "Our organization needs to implement a service mesh architecture with observability-driven SRE practices to achieve our reliability SLOs."

**Translation**: "We want our systems to be more reliable and when problems happen, we want to find and fix them quickly."

### The Communication Challenge

As outlined in our [culture framework](../wiki/operating-model/foundation/culture-framework), clear communication is fundamental to organizational effectiveness. When we hide simple concepts behind complex terminology, we:

- **Exclude Non-Technical Stakeholders**: Business leaders can't make informed decisions about things they don't understand
- **Intimidate New Team Members**: Junior engineers and new managers feel overwhelmed by acronym soup
- **Slow Down Decision-Making**: Time spent explaining terminology is time not spent solving problems
- **Create False Complexity**: Simple problems appear more complicated than they actually are

## Engineering Practices: What They Should Have Been Called

## Why This Approach Works

### Benefits of Plain English Communication

**Faster Onboarding**: New team members can understand concepts quickly without getting lost in jargon.

**Better Cross-Team Collaboration**: When everyone understands what's being discussed, meetings become more productive.

**Improved Stakeholder Buy-In**: Business leaders can make informed decisions when they understand what they're approving.

**Reduced Imposter Syndrome**: Junior team members feel more confident when complex concepts are explained clearly.

**Clearer Problem-Solving**: When you can explain something simply, you understand it better yourself.

### Implementation in Your Organization

**Meeting Ground Rules**: Start meetings by defining any technical terms that will be used.

**Documentation Standards**: Require that all technical documentation include a "plain English" summary.

**Presentation Templates**: Create slide templates that force presenters to explain concepts in simple terms.

**Onboarding Materials**: Develop glossaries and guides that explain your organization's specific terminology.

**Regular Practice**: Make "translation to plain English" a regular part of technical discussions.

## When Complexity Is Necessary

### Appropriate Use of Technical Terms

While plain English is powerful, there are times when technical precision is important:

**Technical Documentation**: Detailed implementation guides need precise terminology.

**Security Discussions**: Security concepts often require specific language for accuracy.

**Vendor Communications**: Some technical discussions require industry-standard terminology.

**Expert Conversations**: Experienced practitioners can communicate more efficiently using shared technical vocabulary.

### The Balance

The goal isn't to eliminate technical language entirely, but to:
- Use precise technical terms when necessary for accuracy
- Always provide plain English explanations when introducing complex concepts
- Check for understanding regularly in mixed-audience conversations
- Default to simpler explanations and add complexity only when needed

## Building a Plain English Culture

### Leadership Modeling

As outlined in our [communication patterns](../wiki/operating-model/foundation/communication), leaders set the tone for organizational communication:

**Lead by Example**: Senior leaders should model plain English communication in all meetings and presentations.

**Reward Clarity**: Recognize and promote people who can explain complex concepts clearly.

**Create Psychological Safety**: Make it safe for people to admit they don't understand something.

**Encourage Questions**: Foster an environment where asking for clarification is valued, not seen as weakness.

### Training and Development

**Communication Skills Training**: Invest in training that helps technical people communicate with non-technical audiences.

**Presentation Skills**: Develop skills in creating clear, accessible presentations.

**Writing Workshops**: Help teams improve their written communication through plain English principles.

**Cross-Functional Exposure**: Create opportunities for technical and non-technical people to work together and learn each other's perspectives.

## Measuring Communication Effectiveness

### Quantitative Metrics

**Meeting Efficiency**: Track meeting duration and follow-up questions as indicators of communication clarity.

**Documentation Usage**: Measure how often documentation is accessed and how quickly new team members become productive.

**Decision Speed**: Monitor how quickly decisions are made after technical presentations.

**Cross-Team Collaboration**: Track the frequency and success of cross-functional projects.

### Qualitative Indicators

**Stakeholder Feedback**: Regular surveys about communication effectiveness across different audiences.

**New Hire Experience**: Exit interviews and onboarding feedback about clarity of communication.

**Innovation Metrics**: Better communication often leads to more innovative solutions as diverse perspectives are included.

**Culture Surveys**: Include questions about communication clarity in regular culture assessments.

## Conclusion

The technology industry's love affair with complex terminology often obscures simple, powerful concepts. By following the example set by resources like [AWS in Plain English](https://expeditedsecurity.com/aws-in-plain-english/), we can make technology leadership more accessible, inclusive, and effective.

Clear communication isn't about dumbing down concepts—it's about making powerful ideas accessible to everyone who needs to understand them. When we explain technical concepts in plain English, we:

- **Accelerate Learning**: People grasp concepts faster when they're explained clearly
- **Improve Decision-Making**: Better understanding leads to better choices
- **Increase Inclusion**: More people can participate in technical discussions
- **Reduce Errors**: Clear communication prevents misunderstandings that lead to mistakes
- **Build Stronger Teams**: Shared understanding creates better collaboration

As technology leaders, our job isn't to impress people with our vocabulary—it's to help our organizations build better software, more effectively. Sometimes the most sophisticated thing you can do is explain something simply.

The next time you're in a meeting and someone uses a term that might not be clear to everyone, try the "plain English" approach. You might be surprised at how much more productive the conversation becomes when everyone truly understands what's being discussed.
