# Getting Started with Technology Leadership Excellence

Welcome to our comprehensive platform for technology leadership and engineering excellence! Whether you're a CTO building your first engineering team, a VP of Engineering scaling an organization, or an engineering manager looking to improve team performance, this platform provides structured frameworks and practical guidance for building world-class technology organizations.

## Our Core Frameworks

This platform is built around two comprehensive frameworks that work together to create exceptional technology organizations:
