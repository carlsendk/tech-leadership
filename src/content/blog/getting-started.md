# Getting Started with Our Knowledge Base

Welcome to our comprehensive knowledge base! This platform combines wiki-style documentation with blog posts to provide you with both structured learning resources and timely insights.

## Navigation Basics

The site is organized into two main sections:

### Wiki Section

Our wiki contains structured, evergreen content organized by categories. It's designed for reference material and documentation that changes infrequently but remains valuable over time.

To navigate the wiki effectively:

1. Use the sidebar navigation to browse by category
2. Use the table of contents on each wiki page to jump to specific sections
3. Follow breadcrumb navigation to understand where you are in the hierarchy

### Blog Section

The blog features chronologically organized posts with timely information, insights, and updates. It's perfect for announcements, tutorials, and thought leadership content.

## Using Tags and Categories

Both wiki articles and blog posts are organized with tags and categories:

- **Categories** provide broad classification (e.g., "JavaScript", "Design Patterns")
- **Tags** offer more specific cross-referencing (e.g., "debugging", "performance")

You can click on any tag or category to see all content with that classification, regardless of whether it's in the wiki or blog section.

## Search Functionality

Use the search bar in the header to quickly find content across the entire site. The search supports:

- Keyword searches
- Phrase searches (using quotes)
- Tag and category filtering
