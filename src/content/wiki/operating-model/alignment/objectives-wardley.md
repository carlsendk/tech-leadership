## Wardley Mapping Framework

```mermaid

    A[Company Mission] --> B[Product Vision]
    B --> C[Team Mission]
    C --> D[OKRs]
    D --> E[Key Results]
    E --> F[Daily Metrics]
    F --> G[Actions]
    G --> H[Outcomes]
    H --> I[Impact]
    I --> J[Strategy]
```

## Mapping Process

### 1. List User Needs
- Identify primary user needs
- Map secondary needs
- Document pain points
- Capture future needs

### 2. Map Components vs Evolution
- Plot components on evolution axis
- Identify dependencies
- Note movement patterns
- Highlight opportunities

### 3. Strategic Decisions
- Build: Differentiating capabilities
- Buy: Market-available solutions
- Outsource: Non-core functions
- Retire: Obsolete components

## Implementation Guide

### First 30 Days
1. Train on Wardley mapping
2. Create initial maps
3. Identify quick wins

### 60-90 Days
1. Regular mapping sessions
2. Strategy alignment
3. Action planning

### Beyond 90 Days
1. Continuous mapping
2. Strategy evolution
3. Impact measurement

## Anti-patterns

### 1. Static Maps
❌ **Problem**: Maps become outdated
✅ **Solution**: Regular updates and reviews

### 2. Technology Focus
❌ **Problem**: Ignoring user needs
✅ **Solution**: Start with user needs

### 3. Isolated Mapping
❌ **Problem**: Maps not connected to strategy
✅ **Solution**: Link to business objectives
