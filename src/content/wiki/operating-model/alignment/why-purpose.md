    A[Why] --> B[What]
    B --> C[How]
    C --> D[When]
    D --> E[Where]
    E --> F[Who]
    F --> G[Impact]
    G --> H[Outcomes]
    H --> I[Success]
```

## Why It Matters

A crisp sense of purpose aligns every decision, from architectural trade‑offs to hiring. It provides:
- Clear decision-making framework
- Team motivation and alignment
- Customer connection
- Strategic focus

## Key Practices

### 1. From/To Vision Statement
```yaml
vision:
  from: "Current state description"
  to: "Future state aspiration"
  timeframe: "3-5 years"
  success_criteria:
    - "Measurable outcome 1"
    - "Measurable outcome 2"
    - "Measurable outcome 3"
```

### 2. Continuous Validation
- Regular user interviews
- Market research
- Competitor analysis
- Trend monitoring

### 3. Strategy Review
- Quarterly strategy sessions
- Annual vision refresh
- Continuous feedback loops
- Impact assessment
