# Foundation Layer

The foundation layer establishes the bedrock principles that guide everything else in your organization. This layer answers fundamental questions: why do we exist, how do we make decisions, and what principles guide our daily trade-offs.

## Layer Components

### Why & Purpose - Product Strategy
Sets the North-Star: why we exist and where we play. Establishes the fundamental direction and market positioning that drives all other decisions.

### Govern with Culture
Scales behavior through principles rather than rules. Creates shared understanding of how decisions are made and work gets done.

### Values
Shared beliefs that guide day-to-day trade-offs. Provides the decision-making framework when policies and processes don't exist.

## Implementation Order

Start here before building any other organizational systems:

1. **Establish Purpose** - Define why you exist and where you're headed
2. **Build Culture** - Create shared principles for decision-making
3. **Define Values** - Establish trade-off criteria for daily decisions

This foundation enables everything else in the operating model to function effectively.
