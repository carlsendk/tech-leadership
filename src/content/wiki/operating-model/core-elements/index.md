# Core Elements

The core elements layer translates your foundation into actionable operational systems. This layer defines what you build, how you measure success, and how you organize to deliver.

## Layer Components

### Mission - Product Canvas
Captures who, what, why for a product slice. Establishes clear understanding of target users, value propositions, and success metrics.

### Objectives - Wardley Mapping
Stress-test bets against landscape evolution. Maps user needs to capabilities and identifies strategic positioning opportunities.

### Organization - Domain-Driven Design
Mirror domain boundaries in team topology. Aligns team structure with business domains for reduced coupling and increased autonomy.

## Implementation Approach

Build these elements in sequence:

1. **Define Mission** - Use Product Canvas to clarify product direction
2. **Map Objectives** - Apply Wardley Mapping to understand strategic landscape
3. **Design Organization** - Structure teams around domain boundaries

These core elements bridge the gap between foundational principles and operational optimization.
