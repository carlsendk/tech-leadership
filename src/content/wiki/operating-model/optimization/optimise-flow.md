## DORA Metrics Framework

### 1. Deployment Frequency
- How often code is deployed to production
- Target: Multiple times per day
- Measurement: Deployments per day/week

### 2. Lead Time for Change
- Time from commit to production
- Target: Less than one hour
- Measurement: Average time in minutes

### 3. Change Failure Rate
- Percentage of deployments causing incidents
- Target: Less than 15%
- Measurement: Failed deployments / Total deployments

### 4. Mean Time to Recovery
- Time to recover from incidents
- Target: Less than one hour
- Measurement: Average recovery time

## Implementation Tools

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - build:
        - unit_tests
        - integration_tests
        - security_scan
    - deploy:
        - staging
        - production
    - monitor:
        - health_checks
        - metrics_collection
```

### 2. Value Stream Mapping
```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'dark',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#0d9488',
      'primaryTextColor': '#f1f5f9',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#475569',
      'lineColor': '#94a3b8',
      'secondaryColor': '#2dd4bf',
      'tertiaryColor': '#14b8a6'
    }
  }
}%%

## Implementation Guide

### First 30 Days
1. Establish baseline metrics
2. Set up monitoring
3. Document current process

### 60-90 Days
1. Implement automation
2. Reduce manual steps
3. Establish feedback loops

### Beyond 90 Days
1. Continuous improvement
2. Advanced automation
3. Cross-team optimization

## Anti-patterns

### 1. Manual Deployments
❌ **Problem**: Human error and slow delivery
✅ **Solution**: Automated deployment pipeline

### 2. Long Feedback Loops
❌ **Problem**: Delayed issue detection
✅ **Solution**: Continuous monitoring and alerts

### 3. Siloed Operations
❌ **Problem**: Disconnected teams
✅ **Solution**: DevOps culture and practices

## Integration Points

### With Other Practices
- Supports [Cost Optimization](optimise-cost)
- Enables [Motivation](optimise-motivation)
- Drives [Mission Delivery](../advanced/mission-objectives)

### With Tools & Systems
- CI/CD platforms
- Monitoring systems
- Incident management

## Related Topics
- [Operating Model Overview](../operating-model-framework)

- [Motivation Optimization](optimise-motivation)

> **Pro Tip:** Focus on reducing lead time and increasing deployment frequency while maintaining stability. Speed without safety is dangerous.
