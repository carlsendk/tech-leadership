## Core Metrics

### 1. Cost per Customer
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- CAC/CLV Ratio
- Cost per Active User

### 2. Cost per Engineer
- Infrastructure cost per engineer
- Tooling and license costs
- Support and operational overhead
- Training and development costs

### 3. Cloud Unit Cost
- Cost per transaction
- Cost per compute unit
- Storage efficiency metrics
- Network cost optimization

## FinOps Practices

### 1. Resource Management
- Right-sizing infrastructure
- Automated scaling policies
- Resource tagging by team
- Cost allocation models

### 2. Cost Visibility
- Real-time cost dashboards
- Team-level cost reporting
- Anomaly detection
- Trend analysis

### 3. Optimization Strategies
- Reserved instance planning
- Spot instance utilization
- Storage tier optimization
- Network cost reduction

## Implementation Guide

### First 30 Days
1. Establish baseline metrics
2. Set up cost monitoring
3. Implement resource tagging

### 60-90 Days
1. Deploy FinOps tools
2. Train teams on cost awareness
3. Implement optimization policies

### Beyond 90 Days
1. Regular cost reviews
2. Continuous optimization
3. ROI tracking

## Anti-patterns

### 1. Cost Blindness
❌ **Problem**: Teams unaware of costs
✅ **Solution**: Cost visibility and education

### 2. Over-optimization
❌ **Problem**: Sacrificing quality for cost
✅ **Solution**: Balance cost vs. value

### 3. Silos
❌ **Problem**: Disconnected cost management
✅ **Solution**: Cross-functional FinOps team

## Integration Points

### With Other Practices
- Aligns with [Flow Optimization](optimise-flow)
- Supports [Mission & Objectives](../advanced/mission-objectives)
- Complements [Team Structure](../advanced/decoupling_teams)

### With Tools & Systems
- Cloud cost management tools
- Resource monitoring systems
- Financial reporting platforms

- [Motivation Optimization](optimise-motivation)

> **Pro Tip:** Focus on unit economics rather than absolute costs. The goal is to optimize the cost-to-value ratio, not just reduce costs.
