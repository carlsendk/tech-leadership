# Optimization & Feedback

The optimization layer ensures your operating model delivers sustainable results through continuous measurement, feedback, and improvement.

## Layer Components

### Alignment & Feedback Loops
Close the strategy-execution gap through regular health checks, retrospectives, and course corrections.

### Optimize for Motivation
Keep humans engaged and creative through eNPS tracking, squad health monitoring, and psychological safety practices.

### Optimize for Flow
Ship value quickly and safely using CI/CD, DORA metrics, and lean delivery practices.

### Optimize for Cost
Sustain profitability at scale through FinOps, unit economics, and resource efficiency.

## Implementation Strategy

Build optimization capabilities incrementally:

1. **Establish Feedback Loops** - Create regular alignment and improvement cycles
2. **Monitor Key Metrics** - Track motivation, flow, and cost indicators
3. **Iterate & Improve** - Use data to drive continuous optimization
4. **Balance Trade-offs** - Optimize across all three dimensions sustainably

This layer transforms your operating model from static structure into dynamic, learning system.
