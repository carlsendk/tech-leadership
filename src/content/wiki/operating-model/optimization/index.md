# Optimization & Feedback

The optimization layer ensures your operating model delivers sustainable results through continuous measurement, feedback, and improvement.

The optimization layer ensures your operating model delivers sustainable results through continuous measurement, feedback, and improvement.

## Layer Components

### Alignment & Feedback Loops
Close the strategy-execution gap through regular health checks, retrospectives, and course corrections.

### Optimize for Motivation
Keep humans engaged and creative through eNPS tracking, squad health monitoring, and psychological safety practices.

### Optimize for Flow
Ship value quickly and safely using CI/CD, DORA metrics, and lean delivery practices.

### Optimize for Cost
Sustain profitability at scale through FinOps, unit economics, and resource efficiency.

## Implementation Strategy

Build optimization capabilities incrementally:

1. **Establish Feedback Loops** - Create regular alignment and improvement cycles
2. **Monitor Key Metrics** - Track motivation, flow, and cost indicators
3. **Iterate & Improve** - Use data to drive continuous optimization
4. **Balance Trade-offs** - Optimize across all three dimensions sustainably

This layer transforms your operating model from static structure into dynamic, learning system.
