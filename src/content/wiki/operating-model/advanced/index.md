# Advanced Topics

Advanced organizational design patterns and practices for mature teams dealing with complex systems and dependencies.

## Key Concepts

### Conway's Law & Team Design
Understanding how communication structures inevitably shape system architecture, and designing team topologies accordingly.

### Decoupling Teams & Dependencies
Strategies for reducing inter-team dependencies while maintaining system coherence and business alignment.

### Mission & Objectives Alignment
Advanced techniques for maintaining strategic alignment across multiple teams and organizational layers.

## When to Apply

These advanced patterns are most valuable when:

1. **Scale Challenges** - Multiple teams working on interconnected systems
2. **Complexity Management** - Business domains with intricate relationships
3. **Organizational Maturity** - Foundation and core elements are well-established

## Implementation Prerequisites

Before tackling advanced topics:

- ✅ Foundation layer is stable (purpose, culture, values)
- ✅ Core elements are functioning (mission, objectives, organization)
- ✅ Basic optimization loops are in place
- ✅ Team has experience with fundamental practices

Advanced organizational design builds on solid fundamentals to handle sophisticated coordination challenges.
