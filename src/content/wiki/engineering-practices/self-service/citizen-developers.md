# Citizen Developers

Citizen development empowers business stakeholders to create applications and automations using low-code/no-code platforms and guided development experiences. When implemented with proper governance, citizen development accelerates innovation while reducing the burden on professional development teams.

## The Strategic Case for Citizen Development

### Democratizing Technology Creation

Traditional software development creates bottlenecks when business stakeholders must communicate requirements to technical teams who then build solutions. Citizen development enables business experts to directly create solutions, reducing communication overhead and time-to-value.

**Business Problems Solved:**
- IT backlog prevents rapid response to business needs and opportunities
- Requirements translation between business and technical teams creates miscommunication
- Simple automation tasks consume professional developer time that could be used for complex problems
- Business process improvements stall due to development resource constraints

**Citizen Development Benefits:**
- Business experts can prototype and validate solutions immediately
- Simple applications and automations can be built without technical expertise
- Professional developers can focus on complex, high-value technical challenges
- Innovation cycles accelerate when business stakeholders can experiment directly

**Process Automation:**
- Employee onboarding and offboarding workflows
- Purchase request and approval processes
- Content review and publishing workflows
- Customer service case management

**Business Intelligence and Analytics:**
- Executive dashboards and KPI tracking
- Sales performance and pipeline reporting
- Project status and resource utilization
- Customer satisfaction and retention analysis

## Governance and Risk Management

### Establishing Clear Boundaries

Citizen development requires clear guidelines about what types of applications can be built by business users versus those that require professional development expertise.

**Citizen Developer Scope:**
- Applications that primarily manipulate business data without complex calculations
- Workflow automation for well-defined business processes
- Reporting and dashboard creation using existing data sources
- Simple customer-facing forms and survey applications

**Professional Developer Requirements:**
- Applications handling sensitive data like payment or health information
- Complex integrations with external systems requiring custom APIs
- Applications requiring custom security or compliance implementations
- Systems that modify core business data or financial records

### Security and Compliance Framework

**Data Access Controls:**
```yaml
Access Level Framework:
  Level 1 - Public Data:
    - Marketing materials and public information
    - General employee directory information
    - Non-sensitive project status data
    - Citizen developers: Full access
    
  Level 2 - Internal Data:
    - Employee performance data
    - Internal project information
    - Budget and planning data
    - Citizen developers: Read-only with approval
    
  Level 3 - Confidential Data:
    - Customer personal information
    - Financial data and transactions
    - Legal and compliance documentation
    - Citizen developers: No direct access

Data Governance Metrics Example:
  Access Compliance: 100% of citizen developer apps follow data access guidelines
  Security Incidents: Zero data breaches from citizen developer applications
  Audit Success: >98% compliance score on data governance audits
  Access Reviews: Quarterly review of all citizen developer data access
```

**Application Review Process:**
- Automated security scanning for all citizen developer applications
- Peer review by other citizen developers for best practices
- Professional developer review for applications using sensitive data
- Regular audits of deployed applications for continued compliance

### Change Management and Lifecycle

**Application Lifecycle Management:**
- Development and testing in sandbox environments
- Approval workflow before production deployment
- Regular review and maintenance schedules
- Retirement process for applications no longer needed

**Version Control and Documentation:**
- Basic version control for application configurations
- Documentation requirements for business logic and data flows
- User guide creation for applications used by multiple people
- Knowledge transfer processes when citizen developers change roles
