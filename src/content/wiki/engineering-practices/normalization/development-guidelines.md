# Development Guidelines

Development guidelines transform individual coding practices into cohesive team capabilities. When done well, they eliminate friction, reduce cognitive load, and enable developers to focus on solving business problems rather than debating formatting or wondering about team conventions.

## The Strategic Value of Development Guidelines

Guidelines aren't about restricting creativity—they're about creating a shared language that amplifies collective intelligence. When teams align on fundamental practices, they can move faster, onboard new members more easily, and maintain systems more effectively over time.

## Branching Strategy Selection

### Choosing the Right Strategy for Your Context

The branching strategy you choose should align with your team's deployment cadence, release requirements, and organizational constraints. There's no one-size-fits-all approach—the best strategy is the one that supports your specific delivery goals.

### Trunk-Based Development

**Best for:** Teams practicing continuous deployment with strong testing automation and feature flags.

Trunk-based development involves developers collaborating on code in a single branch and resisting any pressure to create other long-lived development branches. The key insight is that branches represent inventory—work that isn't delivering value to customers.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Feature A start"
    commit id: "Feature A complete"
    commit id: "Feature B start"
    commit id: "Feature B complete"
    commit id: "Feature C start"
    commit id: "Feature C complete"
```

**Core Principles:**
- **Short-lived branches**: Feature branches live for hours or days, not weeks
- **Small batch sizes**: Each integration represents a small, complete change
- **Feature flags**: Control feature rollout independently of deployment
- **Robust CI/CD**: Automated testing catches issues before they reach production

**When to Choose Trunk-Based:**
- You deploy multiple times per day
- You have comprehensive automated testing
- Your team can break features into small increments
- You use feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Git Flow (Feature Branch Workflow)

**Best for:** Teams with scheduled releases, complex integration requirements, or regulatory compliance needs.

Git Flow provides clear separation between development, staging, and production code. It's particularly valuable when you need formal release processes or when different features have different timelines.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Start dev"
    branch feature/auth
    checkout feature/auth
    commit id: "Auth work"
    checkout develop
    merge feature/auth
    branch release/v1.0
    checkout release/v1.0
    commit id: "Release prep"
    checkout main
    merge release/v1.0
    commit id: "v1.0 Tagged"
```

**Core Principles:**
- **Parallel development**: Multiple features can develop simultaneously
- **Integration stability**: Develop branch maintains a stable integration point
- **Release preparation**: Dedicated release branches for final testing and fixes
- **Hotfix capability**: Emergency fixes can bypass normal flow

**When to Choose Git Flow:**
- You have scheduled release cycles (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Multiple teams work on interdependent features
- You need formal testing and approval processes
- Regulatory requirements demand audit trails

### GitHub Flow (Simplified Feature Branches)

**Best for:** Most teams practicing continuous deployment with moderate release complexity.

GitHub Flow strikes a balance between trunk-based simplicity and Git Flow's safety. It provides feature isolation while keeping the overall process lightweight.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    branch feature/payments
    checkout feature/payments
    commit id: "Payment logic"
    commit id: "Add tests"
    checkout main
    merge feature/payments
    commit id: "Deploy"
    branch feature/notifications
    checkout feature/notifications
    commit id: "Email service"
    checkout main
    merge feature/notifications
    commit id: "Deploy"
```

**Core Principles:**
- **Main branch always deployable**: Production code lives on main
- **Feature branches for new work**: Each feature gets its own branch
- **Pull request reviews**: All changes reviewed before merging
- **Deploy immediately**: Merge to main triggers deployment

**When to Choose GitHub Flow:**
- You deploy daily or multiple times per week
- Your team values both speed and safety
- Code review is important to your quality process
- You want simplicity without sacrificing control

### Strategy Comparison

| Aspect | Trunk-Based | Git Flow | GitHub Flow |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Deployment Frequency** | Multiple/day | Weekly+ | Daily |
| **Branch Complexity** | Minimal | High | Medium |
| **Integration Conflicts** | Rare | Common | Occasional |
| **Feature Flag Dependency** | High | Low | Medium |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Rollback Complexity** | Low | Medium | Low |

## Coding Standards That Enable Flow

### The Philosophy of Consistent Style

Coding standards aren't about personal preference—they're about reducing cognitive load. When everyone writes code the same way, developers can focus on business logic rather than deciphering different styles. The best coding standards are invisible during daily work but dramatically improve code maintainability.

### Language-Agnostic Principles

These principles apply regardless of programming language:

**Clarity Over Cleverness**
- Choose descriptive names over short ones
- Prefer explicit code over implicit behavior
- Write code that tells a story

**Consistency Over Personal Preference**
- Follow team conventions even if you disagree
- Use automated tools to enforce standards
- Prioritize readability by future team members

**Simplicity Over Complexity**
- Break complex functions into simpler ones
- Avoid deep nesting and complex conditionals
- Choose straightforward solutions over elegant complexity

### Essential Standards for Any Team

**Naming Conventions:**
- Functions and variables use clear, descriptive names
- Classes represent nouns, functions represent verbs
- Constants are clearly distinguished from variables
- Abbreviations are avoided unless universally understood

**Code Organization:**
- Single responsibility principle guides module design
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Dependencies are explicit and minimal
- Public interfaces are clearly separated from implementation

**Error Handling:**
- All error conditions are explicitly handled
- Error messages provide actionable information
- Failures fail fast rather than propagating silently
- Recovery strategies are documented

### Example: Effective Naming Patterns

```typescript
// Clear intent and behavior
const calculateMonthlyPayment = (principal: number, rate: number, years: number): number => {
  return (principal * rate * Math.pow(1 + rate, years)) / (Math.pow(1 + rate, years) - 1);
};

// vs unclear naming
const calc = (p: number, r: number, y: number): number => {
  return (p * r * Math.pow(1 + r, y)) / (Math.pow(1 + r, y) - 1);
};
```

## Code Review as Knowledge Transfer

### Reframing Code Review Purpose

Code review isn't about finding bugs—it's about building collective code ownership and transferring knowledge across the team. The most valuable reviews improve overall team understanding and establish patterns for future development.

### The Review Process Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Developer
    participant R as Reviewer
    participant CI as CI/CD
    participant M as Main Branch
    
    Note over D: Feature Development
    D->>D: Create feature branch
    D->>D: Implement changes
    D->>CI: Push to feature branch
    
    Note over CI: Automated Validation
    CI->>CI: Run automated checks<br/>(lint, test, security)
    CI->>D: Report results
    
    Note over D,R: Code Review Process
    D->>R: Create pull request
    R->>R: Review code quality<br/>and functionality
    
    alt Changes requested
        R->>D: Request changes<br/>with feedback
        D->>D: Address feedback
        D->>CI: Push updates
        CI->>CI: Re-run checks
        CI->>D: Updated results
        D->>R: Request re-review
    else Approved
        R->>R: Approve pull request
        Note over R,M: Merge to Main
        R->>M: Merge approved changes
        M->>CI: Trigger deployment
        CI->>CI: Deploy to staging<br/>environment
    end
```

### Creating a Constructive Review Culture

**For Reviewers:**
- Ask questions to understand design decisions
- Suggest improvements, don't just identify problems
- Acknowledge good work and clever solutions
- Focus on the most important issues first
- Provide context for feedback

**For Authors:**
- Provide context in pull request descriptions
- Keep changes focused and reasonably sized
- Respond to feedback constructively
- Ask for clarification when feedback is unclear
- Thank reviewers for their time and insights

### Review Priorities by Experience Level

**Senior Engineers** should focus on:
- Architecture and design patterns
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Long-term maintainability

**Mid-level Engineers** should focus on:
- Logic correctness and edge cases
- Test coverage and quality
- Code organization and clarity
- Integration with existing systems

**Junior Engineers** should focus on:
- Style guide compliance
- Basic functionality verification
- Learning from the code being reviewed
- Asking questions to understand patterns

## Documentation as Product

### Documentation Strategy

Documentation should be treated as a product with users, requirements, and ongoing maintenance. The best documentation serves specific user needs and stays current through automated processes and clear ownership.

### Essential Documentation Types

**README Files as Front Doors**
Your README is often the first impression of your codebase. It should answer:
- What does this project do and why does it exist?
- How do I get it running locally?
- How do I contribute to it?
- Who do I contact for help?

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
Document significant decisions with context:
- What was the problem we were solving?
- What options did we consider?
- What did we decide and why?
- What are the consequences of this decision?

**API Documentation**
For any service with external consumers:
- Clear endpoint descriptions with examples
- Request and response formats
- Error conditions and codes
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting information

### Documentation Automation

**Auto-Generated Documentation:**
- API docs from code annotations
- Code coverage reports
- Dependency graphs
- Performance benchmarks

**Documentation Testing:**
- Verify examples actually work
- Check links aren't broken
- Ensure screenshots are current
- Test installation instructions

## Definition of Done Framework

### Creating Shared Understanding

A clear Definition of Done eliminates ambiguity about when work is complete. It should cover not just functionality but all aspects of production readiness.

**Solution:** Emphasize guidelines as enablers of creativity, not constraints. Show how standards reduce cognitive load and enable faster development.

### Inconsistent Enforcement

**Challenge:** Guidelines applied inconsistently
**Solution:** Automate enforcement where possible. Use tools to catch issues before human review.

### Documentation Drift

**Challenge:** Documentation becomes outdated quickly
**Solution:** Build documentation updates into the Definition of Done. Use automation to detect and flag stale content.

### Review Bottlenecks

**Challenge:** Code reviews slow down development
**Solution:** Optimize review process, distribute review load, and focus reviews on the most important aspects.
